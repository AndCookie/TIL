We have been very pleased with the 1000 but decided to go with the 1400 when we could program two separate individual settings with the remote.  This is very helpful with different needs from two individuals.

Water comes out nicely warm, it’s easy to adjust the position of the jets, the seat warms up fast (I don’t leave it always in), and even the dryer function is nice. Overall, a great purchase.

Easy to adjust the warmth of the seat, water, width and strength of spray etc. And I love that the nozzles are sterilized at the mere push of a button. Now that I have a bidet I realize that I should have gotten one long ago.',\n",

My husband had reasoned he did not need “a pressure washer on the toilet” but is a convert and now would never go back to paper. Cleaner.

When we got it I figured it would last 3-5 years but it sure surpassed that. We just got our second one because we put a new tall and elongated toilet in the master and moved the round one to the other bathroom.Whenever we go on vacation we have to laugh because we miss our Bio Bidet. Others I’ve looked at just don’t compare in my opinion.',\n",

Everything has worked well except that the lid cracked and had to be replaced. The seat has since cracked and a piece of plastic came out by the joint where it connects to the frame and now I have to manually lift the seat up and down now.

The comfortable, heated seat is wonderful, the warm water wash and gentle dry is just sooo much better than using toilet paper.  Not that you will have to have an electrical receptacle installed near the toilet if there is not one available.',\n",

I would highly recommend.',\n",

Be aware though, if you have a rigid water line you might well have to replace your water shutoff valve as well as buying a flexible water line tube. The new replacement flexible tube mayhave a fitting that will not fit your shutoff valve. Once I installed the new shutoff valve at the wall all went smoothly. You’ll want a compression valve, not one that needs soldering.',\n",

Also my friends were so amazed with this bidet they said I’m so high tech, due to I told them the blue light inside the bowl was an ultra violet light that kills the virus in the bowl and your butt.

We installed BB-1000 in our first floor bathroom. We regret we didn’t install one for the kids’ bathroom. BB-1000 has less bulky look and I first didn’t get the use of the remote control. Then, realized when I hurt my shoulder and back. It’s very helpful not to twist to the side to press the button(s). We love both BB-1000 and BB-800.',\n",

For me the forward tilt of the seat is a bit awkward but deters long periods of resting. Most features on the controller are intuitive but some require keeping the User’s Manuel nearby. As a male I have a small reduction in toilet paper use but a resultant cleaner feel.',\n",

My only real complaint with both purchases is that the shiny finish on the seat cover, seat and visible parts can so easily be marred with what looks like dull scratches.  We have never knowingly set anything heavy or abrasive on the bidet.  This is a costly item that is used daily and should have a more durable finish.

Installation was easy following the video instructions and included manual. Took about 15 minutes for this 77 year old. Works like a charm. Easy sequence modifications, position, temperature, pressure, oscillation, etc. Bought one and after installation and first few uses order the second. Very happy user.',\n",
